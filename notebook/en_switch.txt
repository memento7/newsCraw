Nintendo plans to produce at least 16 million Switch consoles in the financial year starting this April , reports The Wall Street Journal , which claims this represents a doubling of the company’s initial plans on the back of strong demand . The only official indication of Switch sales to date is that Nintendo planned to ship 2 million units this month following its launch on March 3rd , though a WSJ source claims the true number may be 2.5 million or more . If the 16 million figure is true , that would put the new console , which is a tablet-style device that is also designed to be used on a TV , well on course to outsell its predecessor , the disappointing Wii U . That system has only managed to sell around 13.5 million units since its launch in late 2012 , versus over 101 million for the original Wii , which sold around 20 million units in a first year that included two holiday seasons . The 3DS portable system , meanwhile , has sold over 65 million units since its launch in early 2012 . Due to its hybrid nature , the Switch could be seen as the ultimate replacement for both the 3DS and the Wii U . Nintendo Switch review : the best portable console Nintendo is unlikely to comment on the matter before April 27 , when it’s due to report earnings for the current fiscal year and issue a forecast for the next . Its forecasts have been known to be on the optimistic side in the past ; three years ago the company was forced to dramatically reverse its fiscal 2013 forecast of 100 billion yen in profit to a loss of 35 billion yen after Wii U sales collapsed over its first year on sale . The company eventually lost 46.4 billion yen that year . That disaster , however , may well have influenced the company into taking a more cautious approach with the Switch .

We’ll bring you more information on Telltale’s Batman and Guardians of the Galaxy titles coming to Nintendo Switch as it emerges . If you 're a hard-core Nintendo fan or a lover of Zelda games , you probably preordered the Switch -- which retails for $ 300 , £280 or AU $ 470 -- the moment it was announced . And having played the spectacular Breath of the Wild since day 1 , on your TV or on the Switch 's built-in 6.2-inch screen , you almost certainly feel it was worth every penny . For everyone else , there 's no rush . Zelda is flat-out phenomenal , but otherwise , the Switch feels like an empty vessel , waiting for a deeper catalog of games and access to retro legacy titles to take advantage of what is arguably Nintendo 's most ambitious and risky effort to date . See how the game landscape looks in a few weeks -- or maybe even a few months . However , since it launched on March 3 , Nintendo has instilled some confidence in the Switch 's longevity , thanks to a commitment to independent gaming ( at least for the rest of 2017 ) and a light , but capable online experience and eShop . Nintendo has really swung for the fences here : the Switch is a hybrid console , meaning it can be played on a TV at home or on the go as a handheld . The Joy-Con controllers make the Switch a veritable Transformer : keep them attached to the sides in tablet mode , slide them off and prop up the screen on a table to play one- or two-player games , or dock the Switch in its included charging cradle to play on your big-screen TV . The idea is that you 'll get the same basic experience regardless of how you play . The Nintendo Switch is a much more elegantly designed console from top to bottom , light-years ahead of the plastic goofiness of its spiritual predecessor , the GamePad on 2012 's Wii U . It feels solid in its construction -- expensive , even -- and demonstrates a mature refinement throughout . Even the operating system is clean and fast -- a stark contrast compared to what the Wii U ran on . Just looking at the Switch 's primary focus of being a practical home-and-on-the-go console , the Switch definitely nails it . There is something awesome about taking a huge game like Zelda with you wherever you go . It is perfect for my train commute to work , and it works well on a plane , too . And while battery life is far from marathon levels , I was able to slow down battery drain using a Tronsmart portable charger , thanks to Nintendo adopting the USB-C charging standard on the Switch . And once you 're done with Zelda , you 'll probably turn to ... playing Zelda again ? That 's because the early Switch lineup is pretty anemic otherwise . 1-2 Switch , which effectively serves as a demo for the Joy-Con controllers , is n't included in the box . And do n't expect any other online entertainment on the Switch 's screen for now -- Netflix and other basic streaming services are nowhere

Nintendo Switch review : a brave and fascinating new console At £280 the Switch is a gamble , but Nintendo has again done its idiosyncratic best to challenge the way we think about games hardware Reaction was largely positive , save for a few niggles about battery life , launch title availability and JoyCon responsiveness . Below , we share a few of our readers’ takes . ‘Nintendo have been clear about the Switch from the start’ The Wii U failed because of a lack of clarity and communication from Nintendo about what it was actually meant to do . They have been clear about the Switch from the start – it’s a home console you can pick up and play on the go . And it just works ! The jump from TV to handheld screen ( and vice versa ) is almost instantaneous . I got Zelda at launch and it’s been an absolute delight to play . If Nintendo can continue to foster well designed , unique ‘Nindie’ games and tempt a few big third party companies back they will have a smash hit . Of course , just their own library of high quality games will keep diehard fans happy . The only gripe I have with the system is the lack of a bundled game to showcase the hardware . 1-2-Switch is not worth the price to buy separately and won’t tempt many people to give the system a chance . A still image from the Nintendo Switch Super Bowl 51 commercial . Facebook Twitter Pinterest A still image from the Nintendo Switch Super Bowl 51 commercial . Photograph : AP ‘The Switch was created by elves riding unicorns’ In the lead up to the Switch’s release I managed to transition from “it’s too expensive / there’s no games / I don’t want it anyway” to “I need it in my life immediately” within the space of a week . Nothing notable took place to cause this change of heart , but that’s Nintendo’s charm – everything they do has a magic to it . Playstations are devised in boardrooms , while the Switch was created by elves riding unicorns in some far off magical kingdom . That’s what I told my wife anyway . It’s a lovely bit of kit , it feels well made and the user interface is intuitive . It’s the best possible way to play the new Zelda game , which no amount of hyperbole does justice . The only problem is what I’m going to do when I’ve finished Breath of the Wild as there really isn’t anything else coming up except a re-release of The Best Mario Kart Game Of All Time . I’m trying not to think that far ahead . Edward King , 36 , Newcastle-Upon-Tyne ‘Breath of the Wild is Nintendo’s saviour’ While the console itself seems neat enough , with seamless transitions from handheld to docked , it is Breath of the Wild that’s surely going to be Nintendo’s saviour . It is the perfect lesson in game design done right . Link retrains as a lumberjack . Facebook Twitter Pinterest Link retrains as a lumberjack . Photograph : Nintendo They have checked every box with loving care , and created the most well rounded , well thought out gaming experience I’ve played in years . Perhaps ever . I’m yet to experience multiplayer games on the console – and it’ll be a while , given how much I shelled out for the console plus BotW – but the vast landscape yet to be discovered in Zelda will keep me going for a good long time yet . Nick , Masters Student , 30 , Edinburgh ‘I find it more satisfying to play as a handheld I’m absolutely in love with Zelda Breath of Wild . The game has matched my high expectations ; it’s totally immersive and a fantastically designed open world that even if it didn’t create waves of nostalgic feelings makes paying the admittedly steep retail price totally worthwhile . From a technical perspective I’ve been impressed with what it can do as a handheld device and I haven’t had any of the technical issues others have had . I find it much more satisfying to play it in handheld mode . I’m not even a Nintendo fan boy , I usually stick to my PS4 and games like Destiny and Witcher 3 but I’ve been really impressed so far . My big worry is that as I’m not really in to Mario Kart and other family games , in a few months it’ll be collecting dust . But hey : Skyrim is coming . James , 30 , London ‘My stay-at-home PS4 seems antiquated’ Although it’s noticeably less powerful than the PS4 , the art style used in the new Zelda game is such that it looks amazing , whether playing in TV or handheld mode , and I’m sure Nintendo will get every last bit of juice out of it with future releases . Switching between the two modes is seamless , and my stay-at-home PS4 seems antiquated when compared with the ‘play anywhere’ capabilities of the Switch .

Photograph : AP ‘The Switch was created by elves riding unicorns’ In the lead up to the Switch’s release I managed to transition from “it’s too expensive / there’s no games / I don’t want it anyway” to “I need it in my life immediately” within the space of a week . Nothing notable took place to cause this change of heart , but that’s Nintendo’s charm – everything they do has a magic to it . Playstations are devised in boardrooms , while the Switch was created by elves riding unicorns in some far off magical kingdom . That’s what I told my wife anyway . It’s a lovely bit of kit , it feels well made and the user interface is intuitive . It’s the best possible way to play the new Zelda game , which no amount of hyperbole does justice . The only problem is what I’m going to do when I’ve finished Breath of the Wild as there really isn’t anything else coming up except a re-release of The Best Mario Kart Game Of All Time . I’m trying not to think that far ahead . Edward King , 36 , Newcastle-Upon-Tyne ‘Breath of the Wild is Nintendo’s saviour’ While the console itself seems neat enough , with seamless transitions from handheld to docked , it is Breath of the Wild that’s surely going to be Nintendo’s saviour . It is the perfect lesson in game design done right . Link retrains as a lumberjack . Facebook Twitter Pinterest Link retrains as a lumberjack . Photograph : Nintendo They have checked every box with loving care , and created the most well rounded , well thought out gaming experience I’ve played in years . Perhaps ever . I’m yet to experience multiplayer games on the console – and it’ll be a while , given how much I shelled out for the console plus BotW – but the vast landscape yet to be discovered in Zelda will keep me going for a good long time yet . Nick , Masters Student , 30 , Edinburgh ‘I find it more satisfying to play as a handheld I’m absolutely in love with Zelda Breath of Wild . The game has matched my high expectations ; it’s totally immersive and a fantastically designed open world that even if it didn’t create waves of nostalgic feelings makes paying the admittedly steep retail price totally worthwhile . From a technical perspective I’ve been impressed with what it can do as a handheld device and I haven’t had any of the technical issues others have had . I find it much more satisfying to play it in handheld mode . I’m not even a Nintendo fan boy , I usually stick to my PS4 and games like Destiny and Witcher 3 but I’ve been really impressed so far . My big worry is that as I’m not really in to Mario Kart and other family games , in a few months it’ll be collecting dust . But hey : Skyrim is coming . James , 30 , London ‘My stay-at-home PS4 seems antiquated’ Although it’s noticeably less powerful than the PS4 , the art style used in the new Zelda game is such that it looks amazing , whether playing in TV or handheld mode , and I’m sure Nintendo will get every last bit of juice out of it with future releases . Switching between the two modes is seamless , and my stay-at-home PS4 seems antiquated when compared with the ‘play anywhere’ capabilities of the Switch . UPDATE : Nintendo Switch received another big games boost , as Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+ , World of Goo , Human Resource Machine and Little Inferno all make their Nintendo Switch debut . The titles can now be downloaded from the Nintendo eShop in North America , although UK players will have to wait a little longer . ORIGINAL : PS4 , Xbox One and Nintendo Switch owners could be treated to a major games boost in the not too distant future . Starbreeze has picked up the publishing rights to System Shock 3 , which is currently down for a PC release . And in a brand new blog post on the System Shock 3 website , Starbreeze said that it 's invested $ 12 million to bring the game to PC and `` other platforms '' . It 's not clear which platforms the publisher is referring to , but Xbox One and PS4 ports are most likely . A Nintendo Switch version is harder to imagine , although Starbreeze is listed as one of the publishers working with the console . System Shock 3 is being directed by Warren Spector , whose previous releases include the original System Shock and System Shock 2 , as well as Thief : The Dark Project and Deus Ex . It 's currently without a release date . PS4 Exclusive Games in 2017 and Beyond PS4 fans are in for a treat in 2017 , with exclusive games that include The Last of Us 2 , Gran Turismo Sport , Horizon Zero Dawn and more . `` We’re greatly looking forward to bringing System Shock 3 to players world wide in our collaboration with Otherside Entertainment and Warren Spector’s team . `` I’ll be first in line to play . '' The views were echoed by OtherSide CEO Paul Neurath , who said : `` We are thrilled to be partnering with Starbreeze for System Shock 3 . `` They truly get games and gamers , and have been able to translate that understanding into a robust publishing business , and build thriving gaming communities around their franchises . '' PlayStation announce new games for March 2017 on PS4 Play Video Lots of new releases are being lined up for the Nintendo Switch , including a potential Overwatch port . Overwatch developer Blizzard has n't ruled out the possibility of the game appearing on Nintendo Switch , with director Jeff Kaplan saying that the company is open minded about new platforms . `` I 'm loving the Switch ! '' Kaplan told users on Reddit . `` My second favourite gaming platform of all time is the 3DS . `` Getting OW on the Switch is very challenging for us . But we 're always open minded about exploring possible platforms . '' While it 's by no means confirmation , the fact that Blizzard is even considering an Overwatch port is good news for the Nintendo Switch .
Nintendo plans to produce at least 16 million Switch consoles in the financial year starting this April , reports The Wall Street Journal , which claims this represents a doubling of the company’s initial plans on the back of strong demand . The only official indication of Switch sales to date is that Nintendo planned to ship 2 million units this month following its launch on March 3rd , though a WSJ source claims the true number may be 2.5 million or more . If the 16 million figure is true , that would put the new console , which is a tablet-style device that is also designed to be used on a TV , well on course to outsell its predecessor , the disappointing Wii U . That system has only managed to sell around 13.5 million units since its launch in late 2012 , versus over 101 million for the original Wii , which sold around 20 million units in a first year that included two holiday seasons . The 3DS portable system , meanwhile , has sold over 65 million units since its launch in early 2012 . Due to its hybrid nature , the Switch could be seen as the ultimate replacement for both the 3DS and the Wii U . Nintendo Switch review : the best portable console Nintendo is unlikely to comment on the matter before April 27 , when it’s due to report earnings for the current fiscal year and issue a forecast for the next . Its forecasts have been known to be on the optimistic side in the past ; three years ago the company was forced to dramatically reverse its fiscal 2013 forecast of 100 billion yen in profit to a loss of 35 billion yen after Wii U sales collapsed over its first year on sale . The company eventually lost 46.4 billion yen that year . That disaster , however , may well have influenced the company into taking a more cautious approach with the Switch .

We’ll bring you more information on Telltale’s Batman and Guardians of the Galaxy titles coming to Nintendo Switch as it emerges . If you 're a hard-core Nintendo fan or a lover of Zelda games , you probably preordered the Switch -- which retails for $ 300 , £280 or AU $ 470 -- the moment it was announced . And having played the spectacular Breath of the Wild since day 1 , on your TV or on the Switch 's built-in 6.2-inch screen , you almost certainly feel it was worth every penny . For everyone else , there 's no rush . Zelda is flat-out phenomenal , but otherwise , the Switch feels like an empty vessel , waiting for a deeper catalog of games and access to retro legacy titles to take advantage of what is arguably Nintendo 's most ambitious and risky effort to date . See how the game landscape looks in a few weeks -- or maybe even a few months . However , since it launched on March 3 , Nintendo has instilled some confidence in the Switch 's longevity , thanks to a commitment to independent gaming ( at least for the rest of 2017 ) and a light , but capable online experience and eShop . Nintendo has really swung for the fences here : the Switch is a hybrid console , meaning it can be played on a TV at home or on the go as a handheld . The Joy-Con controllers make the Switch a veritable Transformer : keep them attached to the sides in tablet mode , slide them off and prop up the screen on a table to play one- or two-player games , or dock the Switch in its included charging cradle to play on your big-screen TV . The idea is that you 'll get the same basic experience regardless of how you play . The Nintendo Switch is a much more elegantly designed console from top to bottom , light-years ahead of the plastic goofiness of its spiritual predecessor , the GamePad on 2012 's Wii U . It feels solid in its construction -- expensive , even -- and demonstrates a mature refinement throughout . Even the operating system is clean and fast -- a stark contrast compared to what the Wii U ran on . Just looking at the Switch 's primary focus of being a practical home-and-on-the-go console , the Switch definitely nails it . There is something awesome about taking a huge game like Zelda with you wherever you go . It is perfect for my train commute to work , and it works well on a plane , too . And while battery life is far from marathon levels , I was able to slow down battery drain using a Tronsmart portable charger , thanks to Nintendo adopting the USB-C charging standard on the Switch . And once you 're done with Zelda , you 'll probably turn to ... playing Zelda again ? That 's because the early Switch lineup is pretty anemic otherwise . 1-2 Switch , which effectively serves as a demo for the Joy-Con controllers , is n't included in the box . And do n't expect any other online entertainment on the Switch 's screen for now -- Netflix and other basic streaming services are nowhere

And do n't expect any other online entertainment on the Switch 's screen for now -- Netflix and other basic streaming services are nowhere It’s been a week or so since the Nintendo Switch came out , so we thought we’d ask our readers how they were getting on with the venerable Japanese game company’s hybrid console . Nintendo Switch review : a brave and fascinating new console At £280 the Switch is a gamble , but Nintendo has again done its idiosyncratic best to challenge the way we think about games hardware Reaction was largely positive , save for a few niggles about battery life , launch title availability and JoyCon responsiveness . Below , we share a few of our readers’ takes . ‘Nintendo have been clear about the Switch from the start’ The Wii U failed because of a lack of clarity and communication from Nintendo about what it was actually meant to do . They have been clear about the Switch from the start – it’s a home console you can pick up and play on the go . And it just works ! The jump from TV to handheld screen ( and vice versa ) is almost instantaneous . I got Zelda at launch and it’s been an absolute delight to play . If Nintendo can continue to foster well designed , unique ‘Nindie’ games and tempt a few big third party companies back they will have a smash hit . Of course , just their own library of high quality games will keep diehard fans happy . The only gripe I have with the system is the lack of a bundled game to showcase the hardware . 1-2-Switch is not worth the price to buy separately and won’t tempt many people to give the system a chance .

The company , known for creating episodic content based around hit shows and movies , has already done well with Game of Thrones and The Walking Dead series . Last year , they introduced a Batman game , which released its season finale a few months back . It was also recently revealed that a Guardians of the Galaxy game is on the horizon . According to various listings from online retailers ( hat tip to CBR ) , it looks as if both the Batman and Guardians games may be coming to the Nintendo Switch later this year . Batman and Guardians of the Galaxy Telltale Games Coming to Nintendo Switch Batman & Guardians Telltale Series Listed for Nintendo Switch The Batman one hasn’t been confirmed , but Guardians looks like it will definitely release on all consoles . Based on the characters from 2014’s hit film and its upcoming sequel , the Guardians Telltale game received a teaser trailer a few months back before also gaining a plot summary and a batch of images from the Telltale game . While not connected to the MCU , the Guardians game follows the exploits of the eponymous crew that film audiences have come to love , as they search for a powerful new artifact and a villain dead-set on keeping it from them . The Batman game , meanwhile , wasn’t as big of a hit for the company as their previous efforts . Still , it’s a fun introduction into the world of Gotham and its various villains ( for more , check out the trailer for the beginning of the Batman series ) . Hopefully , by bringing popular content like the Telltale games to the Switch , it can start to regain some of the ground its lost . After all , if not for the innovative gameplay and fun titles , Nintendo doesn’t stand much of a chance in the modern video game market . We’ll bring you more information on Telltale’s Batman and Guardians of the Galaxy titles coming to Nintendo Switch as it emerges . If you 're a hard-core Nintendo fan or a lover of Zelda games , you probably preordered the Switch -- which retails for $ 300 , £280 or AU $ 470 -- the moment it was announced . And having played the spectacular Breath of the Wild since day 1 , on your TV or on the Switch 's built-in 6.2-inch screen , you almost certainly feel it was worth every penny . For everyone else , there 's no rush . Zelda is flat-out phenomenal , but otherwise , the Switch feels like an empty vessel , waiting for a deeper catalog of games and access to retro legacy titles to take advantage of what is arguably Nintendo 's most ambitious and risky effort to date . See how the game landscape looks in a few weeks -- or maybe even a few months . However , since it launched on March 3 , Nintendo has instilled some confidence in the Switch 's longevity , thanks to a commitment to independent gaming ( at least for the rest of 2017 ) and a light , but capable online experience and eShop . Nintendo has really swung for the fences here : the Switch is a hybrid console , meaning it can be played on a TV at home or on the go as a handheld . The Joy-Con controllers make the Switch a veritable Transformer : keep them attached to the sides in tablet mode , slide them off and prop up the screen on a table to play one- or two-player games , or dock the Switch in its included charging cradle to play on your big-screen TV . The idea is that you 'll get the same basic experience regardless of how you play . The Nintendo Switch is a much more elegantly designed console from top to bottom , light-years ahead of the plastic goofiness of its spiritual predecessor , the GamePad on 2012 's Wii U . It feels solid in its construction -- expensive , even -- and demonstrates a mature refinement throughout . Even the operating system is clean and fast -- a stark contrast compared to what the Wii U ran on . Just looking at the Switch 's primary focus of being a practical home-and-on-the-go console , the Switch definitely nails it . There is something awesome about taking a huge game like Zelda with you wherever you go . It is perfect for my train commute to work , and it works well on a plane , too . And while battery life is far from marathon levels , I was able to slow down battery drain using a Tronsmart portable charger , thanks to Nintendo adopting the USB-C charging standard on the Switch . And once you 're done with Zelda , you 'll probably turn to ... playing Zelda again ? That 's because the early Switch lineup is pretty anemic otherwise . 1-2 Switch , which effectively serves as a demo for the Joy-Con controllers , is n't included in the box . And do n't expect any other online entertainment on the Switch 's screen for now -- Netflix and other basic streaming services are nowhere It’s been a week or so since the Nintendo Switch came out , so we thought we’d ask our readers how they were getting on with the venerable Japanese game company’s hybrid console . Nintendo Switch review : a brave and fascinating new console At £280 the Switch is a gamble , but Nintendo has again done its idiosyncratic best to challenge the way we think about games hardware Reaction was largely positive , save for a few niggles about battery life , launch title availability and JoyCon responsiveness . Below , we share a few of our readers’ takes . ‘Nintendo have been clear about the Switch from the start’ The Wii U failed because of a lack of clarity and communication from Nintendo about what it was actually meant to do . They have been clear about the Switch from the start – it’s a home console you can pick up and play on the go . And it just works ! The jump from TV to handheld screen ( and vice versa ) is almost instantaneous . I got Zelda at launch and it’s been an absolute delight to play . If Nintendo can continue to foster well designed , unique ‘Nindie’ games and tempt a few big third party companies back they will have a smash hit . Of course , just their own library of high quality games will keep diehard fans happy . The only gripe I have with the system is the lack of a bundled game to showcase the hardware . 1-2-Switch is not worth the price to buy separately and won’t tempt many people to give the system a chance . A still image from the Nintendo Switch Super Bowl 51 commercial . Facebook Twitter Pinterest A still image from the Nintendo Switch Super Bowl 51 commercial . Photograph : AP ‘The Switch was created by elves riding unicorns’ In the lead up to the Switch’s release I managed to transition from “it’s too expensive / there’s no games / I don’t want it anyway” to “I need it in my life immediately” within the space of a week . Nothing notable took place to cause this change of heart , but that’s Nintendo’s charm – everything they do has a magic to it . Playstations are devised in boardrooms , while the Switch was created by elves riding unicorns in some far off magical kingdom . That’s what I told my wife anyway . It’s a lovely bit of kit , it feels well made and the user interface is intuitive . It’s the best possible way to play the new Zelda game , which no amount of hyperbole does justice . The only problem is what I’m going to do when I’ve finished Breath of the Wild as there really isn’t anything else coming up except a re-release of The Best Mario Kart Game Of All Time . I’m trying not to think that far ahead . Edward King , 36 , Newcastle-Upon-Tyne ‘Breath of the Wild is Nintendo’s saviour’ While the console itself seems neat enough , with seamless transitions from handheld to docked , it is Breath of the Wild that’s surely going to be Nintendo’s saviour . It is the perfect lesson in game design done right . Link retrains as a lumberjack . Facebook Twitter Pinterest Link retrains as a lumberjack . Photograph : Nintendo They have checked every box with loving care , and created the most well rounded , well thought out gaming experience I’ve played in years . Perhaps ever . I’m yet to experience multiplayer games on the console – and it’ll be a while , given how much I shelled out for the console plus BotW – but the vast landscape yet to be discovered in Zelda will keep me going for a good long time yet . Nick , Masters Student , 30 , Edinburgh ‘I find it more satisfying to play as a handheld I’m absolutely in love with Zelda Breath of Wild . The game has matched my high expectations ; it’s totally immersive and a fantastically designed open world that even if it didn’t create waves of nostalgic feelings makes paying the admittedly steep retail price totally worthwhile . From a technical perspective I’ve been impressed with what it can do as a handheld device and I haven’t had any of the technical issues others have had . I find it much more satisfying to play it in handheld mode . I’m not even a Nintendo fan boy , I usually stick to my PS4 and games like Destiny and Witcher 3 but I’ve been really impressed so far . My big worry is that as I’m not really in to Mario Kart and other family games , in a few months it’ll be collecting dust . But hey : Skyrim is coming . James , 30 , London ‘My stay-at-home PS4 seems antiquated’ Although it’s noticeably less powerful than the PS4 , the art style used in the new Zelda game is such that it looks amazing , whether playing in TV or handheld mode , and I’m sure Nintendo will get every last bit of juice out of it with future releases . Switching between the two modes is seamless , and my stay-at-home PS4 seems antiquated when compared with the ‘play anywhere’ capabilities of the Switch . UPDATE : Nintendo Switch received another big games boost , as Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+ , World of Goo , Human Resource Machine and Little Inferno all make their Nintendo Switch debut . The titles can now be downloaded from the Nintendo eShop in North America , although UK players will have to wait a little longer . ORIGINAL : PS4 , Xbox One and Nintendo Switch owners could be treated to a major games boost in the not too distant future . Starbreeze has picked up the publishing rights to System Shock 3 , which is currently down for a PC release . And in a brand new blog post on the System Shock 3 website , Starbreeze said that it 's invested $ 12 million to bring the game to PC and `` other platforms '' . It 's not clear which platforms the publisher is referring to , but Xbox One and PS4 ports are most likely . A Nintendo Switch version is harder to imagine , although Starbreeze is listed as one of the publishers working with the console . System Shock 3 is being directed by Warren Spector , whose previous releases include the original System Shock and System Shock 2 , as well as Thief : The Dark Project and Deus Ex . It 's currently without a release date . PS4 Exclusive Games in 2017 and Beyond PS4 fans are in for a treat in 2017 , with exclusive games that include The Last of Us 2 , Gran Turismo Sport , Horizon Zero Dawn and more . `` We’re greatly looking forward to bringing System Shock 3 to players world wide in our collaboration with Otherside Entertainment and Warren Spector’s team . `` I’ll be first in line to play . '' The views were echoed by OtherSide CEO Paul Neurath , who said : `` We are thrilled to be partnering with Starbreeze for System Shock 3 . `` They truly get games and gamers , and have been able to translate that understanding into a robust publishing business , and build thriving gaming communities around their franchises . '' PlayStation announce new games for March 2017 on PS4 Play Video Lots of new releases are being lined up for the Nintendo Switch , including a potential Overwatch port . Overwatch developer Blizzard has n't ruled out the possibility of the game appearing on Nintendo Switch , with director Jeff Kaplan saying that the company is open minded about new platforms . `` I 'm loving the Switch ! '' Kaplan told users on Reddit . `` My second favourite gaming platform of all time is the 3DS . `` Getting OW on the Switch is very challenging for us . But we 're always open minded about exploring possible platforms . '' While it 's by no means confirmation , the fact that Blizzard is even considering an Overwatch port is good news for the Nintendo Switch .
